We're going to cache studentIds in user oject

So now we gotta update the cached studentIds when doing student operations

Keep all of the students data cached (To avoid calling DB over and over)


Get all students when a class is selected.
Add attribute to user, students: Dictionary {
                                                "studentId": student,
                                                "studentId": student
                                            }

When to update student dictionary on user object:
    - When a student is added/edited/deleted
    - When points are awarded on Award / StudentTableView / StudentTableViewCell / Market / Attendance / Student View
